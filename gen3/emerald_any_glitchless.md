## Route Rules
- Timing is by the in-game timer, as it shows on the back of the trainer card after reloading the file.
- Runs must be single segment (no save+quit), as otherwise the in-game timer is not accurate.
- Runs must be done on English version.
- Using glitches is not allowed.

## These Notes
Copied from the guide [here](http://wiki.pokemonspeedruns.com/index.php/Pok%C3%A9mon_Emerald_Mudkip/Rayquaza_Route) and personally modified.

### Spinner Manipulation (Run/Walk Method)
Run from below to the square diagonally below-and-right of the trainer, then walk to the next square directly to the right of the trainer. From here you can run or walk, they can't catch you. Be careful when doing this however, as running a single tile higher will guarantee that the trainer catches you.

Any spinner that you have to pass by the left or right of (so you start below them, and then finish above) can be manipulated in this manner, to guarantee not getting caught. However it does not work on spinners that you need to pass above or below, as running into the squares immediately diagonal to a spinner will make them look either up or down, up for the top-left and top-right squares, down for bottom-left and bottom-right.

### VBA-M
The message "The internal battery has died. The game can be played. However clock based events will no longer occur." may appear when you load the game. It is actually advantageous to have this message, as it eliminates random phone calls from registered trainers. Old carts will likely have this warning, and the emulator vba naturally has this warning. However, vba-m does not. To get the internal battery warning with vba-m, go to the folder you have vba-m saved in, and open the vba-over file in notepad. Find the line that reads "# Pokemon - Emerald Version (USA, Europe)", and in the lines below, edit "rtcEnabled=1" to "rtcEnabled=0".

## Notation
- Whenever the route refers to Mudkip's stats, it will be in the form `xx/xx/xx`, where the "`x`"s represent numbers. In order, these refer to the stats `Attack`, `Special Attack` and `Speed`.
- Unless stated otherwise (normally by "use this move until it faints"), battles are detailed turn by turn.

-----

## New Game
Before starting a new game, set your options as:

  - Text Speed - Fast
  - Battle Scene - Off
  - Battle Style - Set

Other options can be set as you please.

Start a new game, and choose Girl (the Brendan 2 fight is much safer as the girl), and name your character a single character name.

## Littleroot Town
Leave the clock at default.

Collect the Potion from your PC.

Once the conversations with Mom are done, head towards Brendan's house. Enter, talk to Brendan's mom, and head upstairs. As soon as you enter the room, leave again and go to walk out the house. Brendan will appear and talk to you.

Head out and north to Route 101 to meet Prof. Birch.

## Route 101
Choose Mudkip after looking in the bag, and then the Zigzagoon fight will begin.

In the battle, check Mudkip's nature and stats. The minimum stats that are runnable are `13/10/9`.

> It is recommended to only accept `13/11/9`, however `10 Sp.Atk` can be run with, but with some time loss (mostly to the 3 double battles in the Magma and Aqua hideouts). `14/10/9+` is also acceptable, as the time gained from `14 Attack` negates the time lost from `10 Sp.Attack`.

Note: Defenses and Hp don't matter in terms of resetting, however higher is better. The best possible Mudkip for a run is Naughty natured, 14/11/10. The possible stat values at Lvl.5 are:

Stat | HP | Attack | Defense | Sp.Atk | Sp.Def | Speed
:----|:--:|:------:|:-------:|:------:|:------:|:----:
Min (-nature) | -- | 10 |  9 |  9 |  9 |  8
Min           | 20 | 12 | 10 | **10** | 10 |  **9**
Max           | 21 | **13** | 11 | **11** | 11 | **10**
Max (+nature) | -- | **14** | 12 | **12** | 12 | **11**

> Note: -nature and +nature mean a decreasing and increasing nature in that stat, respectively.

### Wild Encounter
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
Zigzagoon | Tackle until it faints.

## Littleroot Town
In the conversation with Prof. Birch, nickname your Mudkip a one character name.

Say "Yes" to seeing Brendan, and exit the lab.

From here, head north, through Route 101 and Oldale Town into Route 103. Run from any encounters.

## Route 103
Speak to Brendan to start the first Rival fight.

### Pokémon Trainer Brendan
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
Treecko | Tackle until it faints.

Beating Treecko will level Mudkip to lvl.6.

  - Check its Attack here, if it goes to `15` continue on, if not reset.
  - Take note of Mudkip's health at the end of the fight, you will need to Potion before the next battle if your health is below `7 HP`, below `9 HP` with bad defense, below `10 HP` with `14 Atk`, or below `13 HP` with `14 Atk` and bad defense.

After the Brendan fight return south to Prof. Birch's lab.

## Littleroot Town
After receiving the Pokedex and Pokeballs, exit the lab and talk to Mom (who is standing outside the house). Don't walk past her, as she will then walk to you, which wastes time. From here on run wherever you can.

From here, head north to Oldale Town, then west at Oldale to Route 102, again running from any encounters.

> Note: If you encounter a Poochyena or Zigzagoon before Petalburg City, you can catch it as a Rock Smash slave, however this is slower than catching a Poochyena in Route 116, as you have to deposit it at Petalburg City to avoid a double battle. Poochyena's encounter rate in Route 116 is 28%, so this is down to personal preference whether you catch one here or not.

## Route 102
Head west and battle the first Youngster.

### Youngster Calvin
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
Poochyena | Tackle until it faints.

Avoid all the other trainers by running through the grass, running from encounters when necessary.

Grab the Oran berries to the right of the second youngster.

## Petalburg City
Enter the PokeCentre to set a Teleport point for later.

  - Deposit Poochyena/Zigzagoon if you caught one along the way.
  - Go into "Move pokemon", and move Mudkip into the box first, then take him back out and put Poochyena/Zigzagoon in. This fully heals Mudkip.

Next, head to the Mart.

### Petalburg Mart
Purchase | #
:--|:--
Potion | 1

After the Mart, head to the gym and go through the Wally catching tutorial.

## Route 104
From entering, head south on to the beach, then west, then north, picking up the hidden Potion on the top-left tile of the beach.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rekyuu/speedfuns/master/pokemon/gen3/img/rse/route-104_potion.png)

Pick up the Oran berries above and head towards the second patch of grass.

  - Potion Mudkip if he is `12 HP` or less.
  - Repel.
  - Give Mudkip an Oran Berry.

Run through the grass, behind the trainer, and enter Petalburg Woods.

Head east and then north across the bridge, towards Rustboro City, avoiding the remaining trainers.
  - The double battle on the bridge wont activate with only one Pokemon in your party.

Pokemon  | Holding    | Actions
:--------|:-----------|:---------
Geodude  |            | Water Gun
Geodude  |            | Water Gun
Nosepass | Oran Berry | Water Gun

> If your speed is above 18 here, Nosepass will Rock Tomb initially, to lower your speed.

> If you are at a HP level that a Rock Tomb will kill (around `20 HP`) it will also use Rock Tomb, so potion at these HP levels.

-----

## Rustboro City
After beating Roxanne and collecting the Rock Tomb TM, exit the Gym and head west. A cutscene will activate with an Aqua Grunt, afterwards head north and then east at the T-junction afterwards. The Devon Researcher will talk to you when you approach him. When he's finished, head east into Route 116.

## Route 116
Here begins the HM slave hunting. Ideally you will need:

- Abra (for Teleport)
- Tailow (for fly)
- Poochyena (if you need one, for Rock Smash)

> At a minimum you must have Abra before leaving.

Only nickname the Poochyena, if you catch one.

Take the southern path, running through the grass.

Use water gun on any Nincada you encounter (up to a maximum of 3), as the experience is useful and water gun always kills Nincada.

Avoid Bug Catcher Jose.

Repel after Jose and before Karen, teaching Rock Tomb over Growl in the same menu.

Dodge School Kid Karen.

### School Kid Karen
Pokemon | Actions

Head out of Devon Corp. and a researcher will talk to you. Complete the Match Call tutorial and then teleport back to Petalburg City.

## Petalburg City
If you deposited a Rock Smash slave on your first visit here, withdraw it now.

Head west to Mr. Briney's house, where your rival will appear. Say "No" to the rematch, then enter the house and talk to Mr. Briney to take his boat to Dewford Town.

> **Note:** The patch of grass outside of Mr. Briney's house is worth running through if you didn't encounter a Tailow in Route 116, as it has both Tailow and Wingull. This grass also has Poochyena in it, if you missed one at Route 116, though the encounter rate is lower.

## Dewford Town
On arrival, head north to Granite Cave, avoiding both Fishermen on Route 106.

## Granite Cave
![](http://i.imgur.com/X0xk3Je.png)

Repel upon entering Granite cave, and head west.

- If you still need a Rock Smash slave, in which case you should catch an Aron, Makuhita or Geodude before using a Repel.

Pick up the Escape Rope before the first ladder, then navigate the rest of the cave to Steven.

Talk to Steven (from the side, not from above, so that he takes less steps to walk out), and get the Steel Wing TM.

Escape rope out once he leaves.

## Route 106
Pick up the Stardust north of the Fisherman (making sure to avoid his 4-tile sight).

## Dewford Town
Talk to Mr. Briney and head to Slateport.

Grovyle | Mud Shot, Tackle
Wingull | Rock Tomb

>**Note:** Ideally you want to be in Torrent after this fight. You may get Torrent from the Grovyle, but if not, you will be close, so you can use Tackle twice on Wingull to get torrent, as he will Water Gun or Wing Attack you, which does 12-18hp damage.
