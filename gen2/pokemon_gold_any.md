## Route Rules
- Timing is done by real time.
- Timing starts when New Game is selected and ends when the screen fades to black after Red is defeated.
- Since it is real time, you may save and quit as much as you want.
- Any glitch is allowed, including cloning, creating bad clones, and exploiting the Coin Case to execute arbitrary code.
- Runs must be done on English version.
- Runs must **not** be done on VBA or Gambatte. They emulate certain crucial aspects of the Coin Case exploit in an incorrect manner.

## These Notes
Copied from the guide [here](http://wiki.pokemonspeedruns.com/index.php/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold/Silver/Any%25_Guide) and personally modified.

-----

## Emulator
- [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/) is the recommended emulator. The setting "break on OAM DMA bad accesses" under Options > Exceptions must be set to ON (checked), leave other settings on their defaults.
- Runs on Gambatte or VBA will not be considered as valid runs for world record attempts.

## Beginning
- Set options:

```
  TEXT SPEED: FAST
BATTLE SCENE: OFF
BATTLE STYLE: SET
```

- Set the time to **3:00 AM**.
- Set your name, your rival's name, and Totodile's nickname to a single character. It saves frames.

## New Bark Town
- Say **no** to **Daylight Savings Time**.
- Head to the Lab.

## Professor Elm's Lab
- Pick up **Totodile** and remove the berry.
- You want a Totodile that has `ATK 12`, `SP.DEF 10`, and `SPD 10`.
- *Race Strat: Save immediately before picking up Totodile so that if you get a female Totodile you can get another one without replaying the whole intro again.*

-----

## New Bark Town
- Name your Rival.
- Talk to Professor Elm.
- Return to Route 29.

## Route 29
- If you used up a berry and you have low defense, you may want to get the berry on this route.

## Route 30

### Youngster Mikey
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
**Pidgey**  | Scratch x2
**Rattata** | Scratch x3

### Bug Catcher Don (Spinner)
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
**Caterpie**  | Rage x4
**Caterpie** | Rage x2

> Use Scratch x2 if you have high attack.

## Route 31
- When you get a call from mom, say no to saving money.
- Get the Bitter Berry.

## Violet City Gym

- Heal up using Berries, or a Potion if necessary, if your health is really low.
- Give Totodile a berry if able.
- *Race Strat: Save before Abe so you can retry if he criticals you.*

### Bird Keeper Abe
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
**Spearow** | Rage x4

- Use a Potion.
- Give Totodile the Bitter Berry for later. Alternatively, save it for Slowpoke Well.

### Bird Keeper Rod
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
**Pidgey** | Rage x4
**Pidgey** | Rage x2

- If you have less than `20 HP` you should use a Potion.

### Leader Falkner
Pokemon | Actions

-----

## Violet City
- Go to the centre and heal up.
- Talk to Professor Elm's aide to get the Egg.

## Route 32
- Get the Przcureberry.
- You need to catch a Wooper and see a Bellsprout.
  - Wooper has a 35% encounter rate. Scratch it once and throw balls. If you get down to your last couple of Poké Balls and still haven't caught it, you can try using Scratch again or Rage to weaken him further, increasing the catch chance
  - Bellsprout has a 20% encounter rate, but you also had a chance to see it on Route 31 earlier. Just run away from it, catching it is a waste of time and even at low levels its Vine Whip hurts Totodile.

### Youngster Albert
Pokemon | Actions
:--|:--
**Rattata** | Scratch x2 / Rage x4
**Zubat** | Scratch x3 / Rage x3

- You can opt to grab the Super Potion in the patch of grass before the docks.

### Firebreather Bill (Spinner)
Pokemon | Actions

### Extra Experience
- You need 25 extra experience to get Level 20 after the final fight in the underground and save yourself 3 X items (because the extra level gives you +3 happiness).
- If you hit any spinner in the game, you'll get this extra experience easily. If not, you can kill a wild Pokemon in here after you pass Firebreather Bill to get the experience.
- Every possible encounter you can get on this floor of Union Cave can be oneshot with Water Gun, except Zubats (and Lv6 Rattata in Silver only). All of them give at least 25 experience. If you run into a Lv4 Rattata, you can Scratch instead to save a few frames. Don't try to kill Zubats, they're generally too tanky.
