## Records
- [speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com/pkmncrystal#Any_Glitchless1)

## Route Rules
- Timing is by the in-game timer, as it shows either on the trainer card or on the save screen after beating Red and going through the second set of credits.
- Runs must be done in single-segment as otherwise the in-game timer is inaccurate, reloading to go to Kanto after Lance is allowed.
- Runs must be done on the English version.
- Using Pokédoll to escape the shiny Gyarados is allowed.

## These Notes
Copied from **Crafted's** guide [here](http://wiki.pokemonspeedruns.com/index.php/Pok%C3%A9mon_Crystal/Any%25_Glitchless_Guide) and personally modified.

-----

## Beginning
- Set options:

```
  TEXT SPEED: FAST
BATTLE SCENE: OFF
BATTLE STYLE: SET
```

- Set time to **5:50 PM**.
- Set your name, your rival's name, and Totodile's nickname to a single character. It saves frames.

## New Bark Town
- Set the day to **Sunday**.
- Say **no** to **Daylight Savings Time**.
- Head to the Lab.

## Professor Elm's Lab
- Pick up **Totodile** (*and remove the berry*).

- Totodile has a gender ratio of 87.5% male to 12.5% female. This means that if you see a female Totodile when you are setting a nickname, immediately reset, as it will have a maximum `ATK DV` of `1`.
