## Route Rules
- Timing is done by real time.
- Timing starts when New Game is selected and ends when the screen fades to black after Red is defeated.
- Since it is real time, you may save and quit as much as you want.
- Any glitch is allowed, including cloning, creating bad clones, and exploiting glitch Pokédex modes to execute Arbitrary Code.
- Runs must be done on English version.
- It is uncertain whether Gambatte is an acceptable emulator to use for Pokédex ACE.

## Beginning
- Set options:

```
  TEXT SPEED: FAST
BATTLE SCENE: OFF
BATTLE STYLE: SET
```

- Time does not matter.
- Set your name, your rival's name, and Totodile's nickname to a single character. It saves frames.

## New Bark Town
- Say **no** to **Daylight Savings Time**.
- Head to the Lab.

## Professor Elm's Lab
- Pick up **Totodile** and remove the berry.
- You want a Totodile that is not female.
  - **Recommended:** `SP.ATK 10`.
  - **Useful:** `ATK 12`, `DEF 12`, and `SPD 10`.
- *Race Strat: Save immediately before picking up Totodile so that if you get a female Totodile you can get another one without replaying the whole intro again.*

## Azalia Town PokeCenter
- Save at the PC.
- Give Croconaw `TM31`.
- Teach Croconaw `TM49 Fury Cutter` over any move except `Water Gun`.
- Deposit the Egg into `BOX 1` and switch to `BOX 2`.

### Cloning

#### Clone #1
1. Deposit Croconaw.
2. Switch to Box 1.
3. After going through the 2 "Yes/No" boxes, HARD RESET around 2-3 seconds after the "SAVING...DO NOT TURN OFF THE POWER." message is fully printed. You should practice this glitch before attempting runs, as the timing is not obvious.
4. To check if you cloned Croconaw, use "Withdraw Pkmn" to check if Totodile is in the box. If he isn't, repeat the cloning until he is. If you ended up on Box 1 (reset too late), change back to Box 2, withdraw him, save and try again.
5. Withdraw Croconaw and save the game using "Move Pkmn W/O Mail". Back out of the menu and move on to the "Clone #2" instructions.

#### Clone #2
1. Deposit the two Croconaws.
2. Switch to Box 1 and clone again.
3. If you cloned the Croconaws, withdraw them and use "Move Pkmn W/O mail" to save. Otherwise, try again.
4. Move on to "Clone #3".

#### Clone #3
1. Deposit another two Croconaws this time.
2. Switch to Box 1 and clone again.
3. If you cloned the Croconaws, withdraw one and leave the PC for now. Otherwise, try again.

> Note: If you click withdraw and end up on a white screen, you hit the bad clone frame when you weren't supposed to. This means that you will need to hard reset, then stop cloning for now and make your way to the Daycare immediately. Once there, you'll need to finish this set of regular cloning before you go to Goldenrod Mart.

- Once you're done with the 3 regular clones, head back outside and walk towards the Rival 2 battle.

## Azalia Town
- Just before your Rival fight:
  - Swap your slave to the last slot.
  - Swap your full health Croconaw to the first slot.
  - Remove all TMs from your Croconaws.
  - Use a Repel.
  - Equip the Przcureberry to your lead Croconaw.

### Rival 2

### Getting a Bad Clone
1. Change to Box 3 to save the game.
2. Deposit all 5 Croconaws into Box 3.
3. Switch to Box 4.
4. Unfortunately, I don't have a specific timing to reset. On my test timings, I found out you need to reset somewhere between 2.3-2.4 seconds, but because of human error, the times may be off. If you don't get a bad clone, then try again.

- If your box becomes full because you successfully clone Croconaw 4 times, then you must switch to an UNUSED box.
- If you reset too late and you switch to box 1, then you have to withdraw the Croconaws you deposited, save and try again.
- These are the qualities of a bad clone. The first three are things you can check in the PC, the last you will have to wait a little longer to check. If you don't have a Pokémon with these qualities, then it isn't a bad clone:
  - It must have a really long glitch name.
  - It must be level 0.
  - It must be the opposite gender (female in this case, unless you picked a female Totodile for some reason, which it would be male).
  - It must become level 1 when you withdraw it. You check this in the menu when you deposit it in the daycare.
- Once you do get a Bad Clone, deposit your useless Pokémon and withdraw the last bad clone in the box.

### Journey to Three Itemfinders
- Give the bad clone to the daycare lady, then take it back.
- Swap the Bad Clone in the front of the party (DO NOT LOOK AT ITS SUMMARY)
- Use "Move Pkmn W/O Mail" to move a stable Croconaw to the front of the party (the party should look only have "CANCEL" in front of it)
- If the Croconaw you just withdrew was holding an item, take it off.
- Put the bad clone in the daycare (the bad clone should be in slot 2)
- Swap to an unused box and deposit the first Pokemon in the Party.
- Log off the PC and swap the 3rd Croconaw's moves so that Water Gun is the second move.
- Continue depositing from the FIRST pokemon until you can't deposit anymore (do not scroll down to deposit, just mash A to deposit the first)
- Withdraw the 1st Croconaw in the box.
- Then assuming the new shifted positions of the Pokemon, withdraw the 2nd Croconaw.
- Then assuming the new shifted positions of the Pokemon, withdraw the 2nd Croconaw again.
- Take the Itemfinders off them. Out of your party of 4, the Itemfinders should be on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Pokemon.
- Head to Goldenrod Pokémon Center. If you get an encounter, just run away.
- Head over to the PC in the far corner to start the magic of this speedrun. Then, do the following:
- **SAVE HERE IF YOU ARE UNSURE OF THE UPCOMING GLITCH**

### Balls Pocket Overflow
- Change your Pokédex Mode to A to Z mode.
- Open your Item Menu and move to the Key Items Pocket.
- Swap the second and third Itemfinder, to create a Coin Case.
- In the Balls pocket, the 54 Poké Balls and the 1 Great Ball will have turned into a Coin Case and 255 master balls.
- Swap the Coin Case and Master Balls.
- Close the item menu, log on to the PC and deposit the Coin Case in the Key Item Pocket.
- Change over to the main items pocket and deposit the 9 Flower Mails too.
- Log off the PC, and move to the Key Items Pocket
- Swap the two Itemfinders.
- Your Key Items Pocket now has 255 items, but you can't use it to much use.
- Instead, deposit an Itemfinder from your key items pocket to byte shift your balls pocket so you now have 255 balls.

### Setting up for Arbitrary Code
